# values, so users can set BRD_PWM_COUNT to choose how many of the PWM

# Now the SPI device table. This table creates all accessible SPI
# devices, giving the name of the device (which is used by device
# drivers to open the device), plus which SPI bus it it on, what
# device ID will be used (which controls the IDs used in parameters
# such as COMPASS_DEV_ID, so we can detect when the list of devices
# changes between reboots for calibration purposes), the SPI mode to
# use, and the low and high speed settings for the device.

# You can define more SPI devices than you actually have, to allow for
# flexibility in board setup, and the driver code can probe to see
# which are responding.

# The DEVID values and device names are chosen to match the PX4 port
# of ArduPilot so users don't need to re-do their accel and compass
# calibrations when moving to ChibiOS.
